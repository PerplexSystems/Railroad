An advanced testing library and test runner for Standard ML, highly
inspired by [elm-test](https://github.com/elm-explorations/test) and
[Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto).

This library provides a set of composable functions for writing tests,
along with a built-in test runner.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/PerplexSystems/Railroad.git $YOUR_PROJECT/vendor/Railroad
```

Then reference `vendor/Railroad/sources.mlb` on your project's `.mlb`
file. Example:

```sml
$(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
lib/Railroad/sources.mlb
main.sml
```

## Usage

```sml
val tests =
  describe "math operations"
    [ test "sum 1 + 1" (fn _ =>
        Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1))
    ]

val _ =
    run tests
```

# API Reference

## Railroad

The [`Railroad`](#railroad) module is the root module of this library.

## Railroad.Test

The [`Railroad.Test`](#railroadtest) module consists of functions that are involved in
creating and managing tests.

### concat

`val concat: Test list -> Test`

Concatenates a list of tests.

```sml
concat [ userTests, baggageTests ]
```

### describe

`val describe: string -> Test list -> Test`

Describes a list of tests.

```sml
describe "math operators"
  [ test "sum" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1))
  , test "failing sum" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 3 (2 + 3))
  ]
```

### focus

`val focus: Test -> Test`

Returns a [`Railroad.Test`](#railroadtest) that causes other tests to be skipped, and
only runs the given one.

Calls to [`focus`](#focus) aren't meant to be committed to version
control. Instead, use them when you want to focus on getting a
particular subset of your tests to pass. If you use `focus`, your
entire test suite will fail, even if each of the individual tests
pass. This is to help avoid accidentally committing a `focus` to
version control.

If you you use `focus` on multiple tests, only those tests will run.
If you put a `focus` inside another `focus`, only the outermost only
will affect which tests gets run.

See also [`skip`](#skip). Note that `skip` takes precedence over
`focus`; if you use a `skip` inside a `focus`, it will still get
skipped, and if you use a `focus` inside a `skip`, it will also get
skipped.

```sml
describe "math operators"
  [ test "sum" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1))
  , focus (test "this is the only test that will run" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 3 (2 + 3)))
  ]
```

### run

`val run: Test -> unit`

Runs the provided tests with [default
configuration](#testconfiguration) and exits with success or failure
based on the results.

```sml
run (test "sum" (fn _ => Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1)))
```

### runWithConfig

`val runWithConfig: Setting list -> `

Runs the provided tests with the provided [`Setting`](#setting)s,
exits with success or failure based on the tests results.

```sml
val sumTest =
  (test "sum" (fn _ => Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1)))

runWithConfig [ Output TextIO.stdOut ] sumTest
```

### skip

`val skip: Test -> Test`

Returns a [`Railroad.Test`](#railroadtest) that gets skipped.

Calls to [`skip`](#skip) aren't meant to be committed to version
control. Instead, use it when you want to focus on getting a
particular subset of your tests to pass. If you use `skip`, your
entire test suite will fail, even if each of the individual tests
pass. This is to help avoid accidentally committing a skip to version
control.

See also [`focus`](#focus). Note that `skip` takes precedence over
`focus`; if you use a `skip` inside a `focus`, it will still get
skipped, and if you use a `focus` inside a `skip`, it will also get
skipped.

```sml
describe "math operators"
  [ test "this test will be the only one to run" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1))
  , skip (test "this test is skipped" (fn _ =>
      Expect.equal Int.compare 3 (2 + 3)))
  ]
```

### test

`val test: string -> (unit -> Expectation) -> Test`

Return a [`Railroad.Test`](#railroadtest) that evaluates a single `Expectation`.

```sml
test "sum" (fn _ => Expect.equal Int.compare 2 (1 + 1))
```

## Test.Configuration

The [`Railroad.Test`](#railroadtest) module consists of types and functions that are involved in
configuring the test runner.

The default [`Setting`](#setting)s are the following:

```sml
{ output = TextIO.stdOut }
```

### Setting

`datatype Setting = Output of TextIO.outstream`

Represents the possible settings for the runner configuration.

- Output: Where the output should be redirected to.

## Expect

The [`Expect`](#expect) module consists of assertion functions that
describes a claim to be tested.

### actual

`type 'a actual = 'a`

Represents the actual value passed to an assertion function.

### expected

`type 'a expected = 'a`

Represents the expected value passed to an assertion function.

### comparer

`type 'a comparer = ('a expected * 'a actual) -> General.order`

Represents a function that compares the [`expected`](#expected)
against the [`actual`](#actual) value.

### tostring

`type 'a tostring = 'a -> string`

Represents a function that converts the given value to a `string`.

### pass

`val pass: Expectation`

Always passes.

```sml
test "this sum is always two" (fn _ =>
  if (1 + 1) = 2 then
    Expect.pass
  else
    Expect.fail "man, something is up...")
```

### fail

`val fail: string -> Expectation`

Always fails.

```sml
test "this sum is always two" (fn _ =>
  if (1 + 1) = 2 then
    Expect.pass
  else
    Expect.fail "man, something is up...")
```

### onFail

`val onFail: string -> Expectation -> Expectation`

If the given expectation fails, replace its failure message with a
custom one.

```sml
test "sum" (fn _ =>
  Expect.onFail 
    "this shouldn't be failing" 
    (Expect.equal Int.compare 4 (2 + 2)))
```

### isTrue

`val isTrue: bool actual -> Expectation`

Passes if the provided value is `true`.

```sml
Expect.isTrue (2 > 1)
```

```

### equalFmt

`val equalFmt: 'a comparer -> 'a tostring -> 'a expected -> 'a actual
